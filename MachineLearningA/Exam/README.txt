The associated MLA_exam_full.ipynb is a notebook cointaining all the code I have written for the exam. 
There are markdown-cells seperating the main questions, but the code cells are structured as simple python-files.

Packages used are: Numpy, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
Thank you for the course! I hope the code compiles ;)
