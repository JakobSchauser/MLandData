When setting out on this project, we had no way of knowing where we would end. 
We blanking on initial ideas, but as soon as we opened Scratch, the cat became our big inspiration. We imagined him dancing and prancing and doing acrobatics 
for the entertainment of our players. We harnessed this creative energy by giving the cat the ability to do backflips at the mere press of a button. 
From here the possibilities were endless, so we turned to our knowledge of programming for what to do next. It was obvious! A couple of variables later,
the cat could not only "springe badut" as we say in danish, but also count the (in)famous Fibonacci-numbers as it did. Without stopping to think of the 
philosophical consequences of what we had created, the counting cat needed some gameplay. As all the members of our team have backgrounds in physics, we
wanted to harness this unique possibility to create a personalized game. This turned into a physcial simulation of the Newtonian motion of a free-falling body
using Euler integration of first order. Or in layman-terms: A ball.
We used some vector-math to make an approximate recreation of the bouncing of a real-life ball and finished up by adding a loose-condition and a way to restart.
We also added the obligatory cat pun when you loose.
